The most important objective of this work  is to make data accessing speed fast and  with compression it would be easy to transfer and reducing the disk space required  for storage and also reducing the network bandwidths for transferring the data , it  will minimize the main memory requirements and increase the exchange  performance. Actually the transferable documents vary in huge amount of size  which substantially increases cost of data processing, data storage and data  exchanges over the web XML documents. XML is now being adopted by many  organizations and industry groups, like the healthcare, banking, chemical, and  telecommunications industries.
